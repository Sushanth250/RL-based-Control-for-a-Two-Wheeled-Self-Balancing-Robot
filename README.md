# RL-based-Control-for-a-Two-Wheeled-Self-Balancing-Robot
Two wheeled self balancing robot is physically modelled using Newtonian Mechanics. Then the system is decoupled into two sub systems. Q Learning Value Iteration (VI) and Q Learning Policy Iteration (PI) are implemented and the results are obtained. Further efforts are made to implement control based on Multi Step Q Learning.
